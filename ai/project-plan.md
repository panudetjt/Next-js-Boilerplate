# Project Planning Template

This file serves as a template for planning tasks before implementation and documenting context updates.

## Current Task: Rename Files from PascalCase to kebab-case using TDD

### Task: File Naming Convention Script with TDD
**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

#### Objective
Create a script to convert all PascalCase file names in `src/` and `tests/` directories to kebab-case using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

#### Implementation Plan
- [x] Plan task structure and TDD approach
- [x] Write test cases for script functionality (TDD first step)
- [x] Create script for file name conversion
- [x] Test and refine script until all tests pass
- [x] Execute script to rename all files
- [x] Update import statements in affected files
- [x] Verify no broken references
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md context

#### Success Criteria
- [x] Script passes all test cases
- [x] All files follow kebab-case naming convention
- [x] No broken imports or references
- [x] Code compiles and runs without errors

#### Context Updates Needed
- [x] Document TDD approach for scripts
- [x] Add kebab-case naming convention
- [x] Document script creation process
- [x] Update vitest configuration for test colocation

#### Notes
Will use Node.js script with:
- Test framework (Vitest already available)
- File system operations
- String conversion utilities
- Import statement updating logic
